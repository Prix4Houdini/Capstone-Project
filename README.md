# Capstone-Project

Code Execution:

1. Move to the ‘src’ directory present in the master directory.
2. *Execute the following command in the CLI- python3 main.py <path_to_verilog_file> 
3. Check for a ‘.vba’ file generated by the python script as the output which contains the compiled code that is in standard Verilog syntax.

*The Verilog file passed in the CLI must contain the user-defined base module along with the tree and/or chain functions with valid parameters. 
Pre-coded files can be found in the master directory.
